# mermaid-autoloader.js
Generate mermaid from text with scaling support


1. In your html add(use index.html & mermaid-autoloader.js)
```
<div class="mermaid"></div>
<script src="./mermaid-autoloader.js"></script>>
```
3. You need to put the address of the text you want to import after the link
4. Open http://127.0.0.1/456/index.html?path=./123.md to see that

lite: If you only want to add zoom and drag functionality, you can use the ```move&zoom.html```
